# WeRateDogs

## Introduction
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

Real-world data rarely comes clean, hence needs to wrangle it. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from 3 different sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it and saved in csv format before visualisation. In this project, I focused on Data Warangling.
